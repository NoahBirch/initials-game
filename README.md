# initials-game

Initials is a game I have often played with friends as a pen and paper game.

The goal of the game is to think names that fit a given set of initials. 
The names you provide should be names of well known people or ficitonal characters, as the game relies on the other players to confirm if your name is valid. 

This python 3 based version of the game I am building so far has this functionality:
  - 1 player mode only, currently set to 60 second duration (classic game is played over 10 minutes)
  - Automatically generate 26 sets of initials based on user picked criteria
  - Accepts and commits your entries to a temporary list.
