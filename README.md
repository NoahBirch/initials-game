# initials-game

Initials is a game I have often played with friends as a pen and paper game.

The goal of the game is to think names that fit a given set of initials. 
The names you provide should be names of well known people or ficitonal characters, as the game relies on the other players to confirm if your name is valid. 

For example, lets say these are your first 3 sets of initials: (you usually play with 26 sets per round)
  - AD - 
  - BM - 
  - CA -

Here are some valid names you could add to your list:
  - AD - Albus Dumbledore
  - BM - Billy Mays
  - CA - Christina Aguilera

Then at the end of the game you tally up points (not in this version of the game yet)

This python 3 based version of the game I am building so far has this functionality:
  - 1 player mode only, currently set to 60 second duration (classic game is played over 10 minutes)
  - Automatically generate 26 sets of initials based on user picked criteria
  - Accepts and commits your entries to a temporary list.
